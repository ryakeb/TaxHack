# TaxHack

A small demo app to play with tax calculations in a gamified way. Provide your gross income, expenses and status (freelance, society or employee) and see an estimate of taxes, social contributions and net income.

This is **not** official tax advice. It is a simple script for experimentation.

## Running the simulation

Run the Python script and follow the prompts:

```bash
python3 tax_game.py
```

You can also activate the Tesla scenario when prompted to see how buying a Tesla might affect your taxable income in this simplified model.
